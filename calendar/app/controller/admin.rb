    # and copying it here to be compared with pass provided by user,

    # `crudify` will automatically create all needed CRUD actions
    # and will map them to corresponding methods of EntryModel.
    # so when we issue a GET request it will fetch a entry by given ID and return it to us.
    # when a POST request issued it will create a new entry based on provided data.
    # on PUT requests it will fetch entry by given ID and update it with given data.
    # by default, `crudify` will use :index action to listen for requests.
    # but we index action for user interface, so telling `crudify` to use another action
    # by passing it as second argument.
    # in our case it will use /crud URL to serve CRUD requests and will create following actions:
    #   - get_crud
    #   - post_crud
    #   - put_crud
    #   - delete_crud
    #   etc.

    # to execute a hook that will run after a successful db operation.
    # the hook will update connections sticked to the date of CRUDed row.
